The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Python is a great language for text processing and quick scripting.
Text processing includes tokenization, counting, and cleaning noisy text.

This sample provides a tiny paragraph of text so you can test your word counts and filters.
Feel free to add more lines, punctuation, and repeated words to exercise your code.
